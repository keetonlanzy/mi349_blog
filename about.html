    <p>My name is Keeton Lanzinger and I am a sophomore at Michigan State University. I am majoring in Information Science. As you can see by my blog topics, I have always had quite some interest in technology. A few of my other interests include:</p>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>Soccer</li>
            <li>Ultimate Frisbee</li>
            <li>Yard Games</li>
            <li>Video Games (Occasionally)</li>
        </ul>
    </nav>
    <p>My interests sort of clash each other because I love being active and playing games, but I also enjoy sitting at my computer doing things like programming. I am excited to continue to learn about many aspects of technology!</p>
