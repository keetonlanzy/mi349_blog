            <h2>Apple's New iPhone 14 Pro</h2>
            <p><p>Author: Keeton Lanzinger <br> Published: 10/16/2022 <br> <br>Apple has finally made another one of their big redesigns. The iPhone 14 Pro is now available and it is breathtaking. The most obvious change that Apple has made here is the replacement of the "notch" seen on the iPhone X through iPhone 13 with a new pill-shaped design that they call "Dynamic Island”. This new feature allows notifications and many other elements of IOS to be presented in a new, fascinating way. The animations that Apple developed to work with this new design are very satisfying. One of my favorite things about Apple has always been how they can make their hardware and software work so nicely together. They also added an always-on display, meaning you can get a glimpse of the information on your lock screen without tapping the screen. To accompany this new screen, they developed new software that allows your lock screen the be highly customizable. This new screen is two times brighter in the sun, reaching a peak of 2000 nits. Apple also, like always, improved the cameras by including a quad-pixel sensor. Professional photographers can do amazing things with this camera and all of its new features. This new iPhone is definitely something I am going to want to get my hands on. </p>

            <h2>Wi-Fi 6E</h2>
            <p>Author: Keeton Lanzinger <br> Published: 10/16/2022 <br> <br>Wi-Fi 6E brings many new features to the wireless internet game. Most Wi-Fi today is either a 2.4 GHz or 5GHz band. While a 2.4 GHz band has 11 channels that are each 20 megahertz, Wi-Fi 6E’s 6 GHz band has 60 channels that can be up to 160 MHz wide. Wi-Fi 6 allows a single transfer signal to deliver data to multiple different devices. Just imagine how much this one additional feature could improve your Wi-Fi speeds. Most of us share our Wi-Fi with others, whether that be in a house with a family or an entire apartment complex. Wi-Fi 6’s new features makes your Wi-Fi’s ability to meet the requirements of many devices much easier and more efficient. One of the draw-backs of Wi-Fi 6E is that communication between the router and a device can easily be interrupted. If a large appliance or wall is between you and your router, you will likely switch back over to 5 GHz. Wi-Fi 6E is also still very new, so many devices (including new ones, like the Playstation 5 and iPhone 14) do not yet support it. There are routers available that are equipped with it, but most of your devices probably are not ready for it.</p>
